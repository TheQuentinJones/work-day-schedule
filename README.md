# Work Day Planner

## Description

    This project is a work day planner. It is meant to log the items that need to be done throughout the
    9AM to 5PM work day. One can easily type in the tasks that need to get done in the time block in which 
    they need to get done. Those items can be saved in the block where they were typed and can be retrieved 
    even if the the page has been refreshed or closed.

    Throughout the day the text blocks will change color indicating whether the time block is in the past, 
    current, or in the future. The planner also includes the current date at the top for your reminder.
